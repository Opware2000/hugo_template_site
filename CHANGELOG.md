### 2015/10/18 - Rename i10n to l10n

Since the right shortcut of localization is "l10n" and not "i10n" (from internationalization) I renamed the shortcut in all places of the theme. The most significant change is the renaming of the `i10n.toml` file inside the `data` folder to `l10n.toml`. This has the side effect that all key paths used for l10n changed within the templates too.
